# LDK Server GUI

A graphical user interface for interacting with ldk-server, built with [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui).

## Building

```bash
cargo build -p ldk-server-gui --release
```

## Running

```bash
cargo run -p ldk-server-gui
```

Or run the release binary directly:

```bash
./target/release/ldk-server-gui
```

## Configuration

Once the GUI opens, configure the connection in the **Node Info** tab:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Server URL | The ldk-server REST API address (without `https://`) | `localhost:3002` |
| API Key | Your server's API key from the config file | |
| TLS Cert Path | Path to the server's TLS certificate | `/tmp/ldk-server/tls_cert.pem` |

The TLS certificate is auto-generated by ldk-server on first startup and is located at `<storage_dir>/tls_cert.pem`.

Click **Connect** to establish a connection.
