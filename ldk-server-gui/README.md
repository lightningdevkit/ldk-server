# LDK Server GUI

A graphical user interface for interacting with ldk-server, built with [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui).

## Prerequisites

**Important:** You must start ldk-server before launching the GUI.

The server generates the TLS certificate on first startup, which is required for the GUI to connect.

```bash
# 1. First, start the ldk-server
cargo run -p ldk-server -- --config /path/to/ldk-server-config.toml

# 2. Wait for the server to start and generate the TLS certificate
#    You should see output indicating the server is listening

# 3. Then start the GUI (in a separate terminal)
cargo run -p ldk-server-gui
```

## Building

```bash
cargo build -p ldk-server-gui --release
```

## Running

```bash
cargo run -p ldk-server-gui
```

Or run the release binary directly:

```bash
./target/release/ldk-server-gui
```

## Configuration

### Auto-loading from Config File

The GUI automatically searches for `ldk-server-config.toml` in these locations:
- Current directory
- `../ldk-server/` directory
- Parent directory
- Path specified in `LDK_SERVER_CONFIG` environment variable

When found, the connection settings are auto-populated from the config file.

You can also click **Load Config** to manually browse for a config file.

### Manual Configuration

If no config file is found, configure the connection manually in the **Node Info** tab:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Server URL | The ldk-server REST API address (without `https://`) | `localhost:3002` |
| API Key | Your server's API key from the config file | |
| TLS Cert Path | Path to the server's TLS certificate | `/tmp/ldk-server/tls_cert.pem` |

The TLS certificate is auto-generated by ldk-server on first startup and is located at `<storage_dir>/tls_cert.pem`.

Click **Connect** to establish a connection.
