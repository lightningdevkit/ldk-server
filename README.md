# LDK-Server

**LDK-Server** is a fully-functional Lightning node in daemon form, built on top of
[LDK-Node](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/ldk-node), which itself provides a powerful abstraction over the
[Lightning Development Kit (LDK)](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning) and uses an in-built
[Bitcoin Development Kit (BDK)](https://bitcoindevkit.org/) wallet.

The primary goal of **LDK-Server** is to provide an efficient, stable, and API-first solution for deploying and managing
a Lightning Network node. With its streamlined setup, **LDK-Server** enables users to easily set up, configure, and run
a Lightning node while exposing a robust, language-agnostic API via [Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)](https://protobuf.dev/).

### Features

- **Out-of-the-Box Lightning Node**:
    - Deploy a Lightning Network node with minimal configuration, no coding required.

- **API-First Design**:
    - Exposes a well-defined API using Protobuf, allowing seamless integration with HTTP-clients or applications.

- **Powered by LDK**:
    - Built on top of LDK-Node, leveraging the modular, reliable, and high-performance architecture of LDK.

- **Effortless Integration**:
    - Ideal for embedding Lightning functionality into payment processors, self-hosted nodes, custodial wallets, or other Lightning-enabled
      applications.

### Project Status

ðŸš§ **Work in Progress**:
- **APIs Under Development**: Expect breaking changes as the project evolves.
- **Potential Bugs and Inconsistencies**: While progress is being made toward stability, unexpected behavior may occur.
- **Improved Logging and Error Handling Coming Soon**: Current error handling is rudimentary(specially for CLI), and usability improvements are actively being worked on.
- **Pending Testing**: Not tested, hence don't use it for production!

We welcome your feedback and contributions to help shape the future of LDK-Server!
